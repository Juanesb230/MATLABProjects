## 1. Kinematic controls with  low compute algorithms

<p align="justify">
These codes are in the ComputingControl folder. Only press play  in the GUIControl file and can see the simple interface. This file has a PD, PID-D and SMC control for trajectory control, you have to put the initial position de robot, kind of control, kind of trajectory, tuning constants, kind of GUI robot and its color.
